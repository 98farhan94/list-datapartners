## How to become a data partner

_outline process_

## List Usage

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/list-datapartners
```

This list is published as a npm module and our [`market`](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market) uses it as a dependency to enhance the UI for those data partners.

After every change, a new version of the list needs to be released:

```bash
npm run release
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's machine with release scripts.

### Production

From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger Travis to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)
