## How to become a data partner

_outline process_

## List Usage

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/list-datapartners
```

This list is published as a npm module and our [`market`](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market) uses it as a dependency to enhance the UI for those data partners.

After every change, a new version of the list needs to be released:

```bash
npm run release
```
